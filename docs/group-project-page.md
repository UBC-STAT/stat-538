## Group Project

Students will work in groups to complete a final project. The project can be focused on the review of a paper from the literature related to the course content with applications to a dataset or new simulations, or the analysis of a real dataset. In either case, each group will submit an electronic report with a fully reproducible and transparent analysis using a Jupyter notebook. Throughout the document, markdown cells will be used to communicate the question asked, methods used, and the conclusion reached.

For this project, you will need to formulate a research question of your choice or a present a method to review. You need to connect the question/topic with concepts learned in the course, and use a dataset or simulation study in your quantitative analysis. 

### Deliverable 1: Project Proposal (2% of the 30% total for the project)

Each group is expected to select a paper to review or a dataset to anlayze using topics learned in the course. Each group will present the ideas in class and we'll discuss the relevance and connection to course topics. 


### Deliverable 2: Oral Presentation (8% of the 30% total for the project)

Each group will make an oral presentation. Each presentation should be less than 20 minutes long, and consist of slides that summarize the material that you plan to include in the report. This will be presented in the last two lectures of class. At the end of each presentation there will be a 5 min slot for Q&A. Although this is a group presentation, each student will be evaluated individually based on presentation skills, ability to respond to questions, and participation in other presentations. Both the quality of slides and the oral delivery will be evaluated (half of the marks each).

### Deliverable 3: Final Report (20% of the 30% total for the project)

Each group will create a final electronic report (max 2000 written
words, not including citations) using Jupyter to communicate the
question asked, the analysis performed and the conclusion reached.

Only one member of your team needs to submit. You must submit **two files**:

- the source Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file)
- the rendered final document (`.html` file)
- Each report should include the following sections:
  - Title
  - Introduction
  - Methods and Results
  - Discussion
  - References

#### Introduction

Begin by providing some relevant background information on the topic so
that someone unfamiliar with it will understand the rest
of your report. Indicate what you expect to achieve and what impact could your results have in future work. Be sure to include at least two
scientific publications that can help frame your study (include all citations in the References section).

In particular for:

**Paper Review**
Identify and describe the methodology proposed in the paper selected. Frame the proposed methodology in the context of what was learned in the course. Include related
citations in the References section.

**Real Data Analysis**
Clearly state the question you will try to answer with your project. Identify and describe the dataset that will be used to answer the
question. Remember, this dataset may contain more variables
than you need, in fact, exploring how the different variables in the dataset affect your model, 
is a crucial part of the project. Indicate which variable is the response and which ones would be potential relevant covariates in your analysis.

#### Methods and Results

In this section include a brief technical description of the method(s) you are reviewing or plan to use in all stages of your data analysis. If the method was covered in class you can just refer to the lecture notes. Your analysis must be fully reproducible and transparent. Comment code cells to make your analysis easy to follow. Use effective visualizations or summary tables in your analysis. Make sure that your tables and/or figures are labeled with a figure/table number. Acknowledge any content that comes from other sources using proper citation.

#### Discussion

In this section, youâ€™ll interpret the results you obtained in the previous section with respect to the main question/goal of your project.

- Summarize what you found, and the implications/impact of your findings.
- If relevant, discuss whether your results were what you expected to find.
- Discuss how your model could be improved;
- Discuss future questions/research this study could lead to.


#### References

Make sure to cite the source of any data or reference used in the report. Also acknowledge any source that you use to learn about the topic or get inspired.
