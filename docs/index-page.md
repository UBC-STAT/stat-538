### Course Description

This is a (mostly) applied graduate course on estimation, inference and prediction of generalized linear models (GLMs). These statistical models extend classical linear models beyond the framework of normal response variables. GLM provides a unifying framework to model the expectation of a response variable as a function of a linear combination of the input variables, when the distribution of the response belongs to an
exponential family (e.g., normal, binomial, Poisson, etc). The course also focuses on computational aspects to fit these models as well as on writing reproducible and transparent computer scripts and reports.
